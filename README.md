# MCLI: Your Company's Simplified CLI Tool

This repository hosts an example of a CLI (Command Line Interface) application designed to streamline various daily tasks for engineers within a company. These tasks include deployments, server connections, log retrieval, and more.

Explore the benefits of creating your own CLI tool in your organization in this article: [Why You Should Consider Creating Your Own CLI Tool in Your Company](https://www.florianbertholin.com/why-you-should-consider-creating-your-own-cli-tool-in-your-company).

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to customize and add your own commands to meet your specific needs.
2. Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a new release on GitHub using semantic versioning (e.g., 1.2.3) without a 'v' prefix.
3. GitHub will automatically build the release, allowing you to download it.
4. With this setup, your CLI tool will automatically update itself whenever a new release is available. Like magic!
