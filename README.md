You can read more about that here: https://www.florianbertholin.com/why-you-should-consider-creating-your-own-cli-tool-in-your-company

## Setup

You can fork this repo and add your own commands fitting your requirements.
When you're happy with your changes, just create a new release on Github with semenatic versioning(eg. 1.2.3) (Don't use a v-prefix)

Github will build the release, and then you can download it.

From that point, any time you release a new release, you cli will get updated when it starts. Magic!
